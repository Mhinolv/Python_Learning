## README
This repository was built to demonstrate my personal learning journey through Python. The goal is to start with basics and work my way up to Machine Learning. This repo will act as a house for my progress over time as well as projects that worked on throughout the journey.

### Organization
This is subject to change, and I might forget to update this portion of the README. Most of all the files found within the folders are going to be contained in Jupyter notebooks. This is because they allow for easy notetaking and execution proceses in parallel, and are just cleaner to read in general. The organzation as it stands right now is this:

**Learning:** Consider these notebooks as scratch/note taking notebooks while I progress through topics in themes in Python.

**Projects:** Consider these are fully operational snippets of code tailored towards a specific use case. All projects will have an introduction and scope. If not, shame on me!

**Files:** This folder will be the housing for all files that are used within Learning and Projects.
