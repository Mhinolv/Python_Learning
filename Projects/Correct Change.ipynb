    "WHen I was younger I really did not like math at all. It really was not until I got my first taste of Data Science that I became more of a fan of math and math related problems. I remember early problems problems that always REALLY bothered me for some reason was correct change questions. As in \"if an apple is 29 cents and you pay 50 cents how much will you get back?\" To prove that I have turned a new leaf I am going to design something similar where a target amount is given, and based on a list on items, two must create the correct change."
